-- the files qc_X0Nstar.m carry out quadratic Chabauty for X_0(N)^* (using code by [BDMTV]: https://github.com/steffenmueller/QCMod)
-- the files elliptic Chabauty/ec_X0Nstar.m carry out elliptic curve Chabauty for X_0(N)^*
-- the files Coleman/cc_X0Nstar.m carry out classical Coleman--Chabauty for X_0(N)^* (using code by [Balakrishnan--Tuitman]: https://github.com/jtuitman/Coleman)
-- the file Coverings/X0N_coverings.m computes X_0(N) -> X_0(N)^* for N = 133, but can be easily adapted for all N such that X_0(N) is non-hyperelliptic
-- the file genus-3-4-5/genus3-4-5.m contains an alternative proof for X_0(N)^* of genus > 2
